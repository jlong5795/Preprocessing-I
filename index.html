  <div class="about-me">
    <p>I have a proven track record of fast learning and problem solving in diverse environments. I take those experiences and utilize them to help analyze project needs and tailor appropriate solutions to address them.

    Additionally, my career in retail and event planning has helped me to develop the ability to work well with a wide range of people from different backgrounds. Communicating with teams and decision makers is smooth and clear, which can be one of the biggest hurdles for working with outside consultants.
